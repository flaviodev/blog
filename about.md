I am a creative and dedicated developer, with over 13 years of experience in various development environments and business activities, working in different positions and with different projects and technologies. Currently I work full remote at C6 Bank (by Invillia) as a back-end specialist, on an incredible product, a super efficient team and an innovative and productive stack.

I am passionate about developing great solutions, I really like new challenges and I love studing. So, I created this space to write my notes.
