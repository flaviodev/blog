I'm a developer with more than 13 years of experience, working in different areas of business, designs and technologies.

My hard skills are Java / Kotlin back-end development, creating microservices and applying design projects like DDD, in addition to having good experience with full stack development.

Currently, I work full remote at C6 Bank (by Invillia) as a back-end specialist, on an incredible product, a super efficient team and an innovative and productive stack.

I like to learn new languages ​​and technologies and I'm interested in what helps me to be productive and create great code, such as tests, clean code, best practices and patterns.


I'm passionate about developing great solutions, I really like new challenges and I love studing. So, I created this space to write my notes.
